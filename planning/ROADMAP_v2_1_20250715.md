# AUS-OA Model v2 Development Roadmap

**File Version:** 1
**Date:** 2025-07-15

## Preamble

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for Version 2 of the AUS-OA microsimulation model. It is the synthesis of extensive consultation with a wide range of clinical, health economic, policy, consumer, and technical stakeholders. The goal of V2 is to transform the model from a research tool into a robust, transparent, and policy-relevant platform for decision-making in osteoarthritis.

## Phase 1: Architectural Relaunch & Foundational Capabilities

**Objective:** Re-engineer the model's architecture to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, while incorporating key new capabilities identified by stakeholders.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 1.1: Software Engineering Best Practices**
    *   Refactor the entire project into a formal R package structure.
    *   Implement `renv` for rigorous dependency management.
    *   Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing.
    *   Containerize the model environment using Docker for full reproducibility.
    *   Adopt agile project management using a GitHub Projects board.

*   **Pillar 1.2: Decoupled & Enhanced Configuration**
    *   Externalize all model parameters (coefficients, costs, probabilities) into human-readable YAML configuration files.
    *   Develop a flexible "policy lever" system in the configuration to easily model new interventions and scenarios.

*   **Pillar 1.3: Performance Optimization**
    *   Profile the existing code to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Refactor core data manipulation logic to use the high-performance `data.table` package.
    *   Transition all data I/O from CSV/Excel to the efficient Parquet format using the `arrow` package.

*   **Pillar 1.4: Foundational Module Expansion**
    *   **Enhanced Costing Module:** Develop a formal, auditable costing module that distinguishes between direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect (productivity) costs, all linked to external, sourced data files.
    *   **Detailed Pharmacy Module:** Create a flexible module for pharmacological interventions that can model different drug classes, adherence rates, side effects, and dynamic treatment switching.
    *   **Surgical & Revisions Module:** Enhance the surgery module to differentiate revision reasons (e.g., infection, loosening) and incorporate long-term implant survivorship data (e.g., from AOANJRR).

## Phase 2: Expanding the Scope of Analysis

**Objective:** Build upon the new architecture to incorporate the key clinical, economic, and equity questions identified by stakeholders.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 2.1: Deepening the Clinical Realism**
    *   Integrate Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) like pain and function scores as key drivers of the model.
    *   Model key surgical complications (e.g., PJI, DVT).
    *   Incorporate the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (physiotherapy, weight loss).
    *   Add modules for key comorbidities and their impact on OA progression.

*   **Pillar 2.2: Broadening the Economic & Social Perspective**
    *   Integrate the impact on carers (informal care costs, quality of life).
    *   Model the link to the residential aged care system.
    *   Analyze equity and access, using new geographic (remoteness) and socioeconomic variables in the synthetic population.

*   **Pillar 2.3: Advanced Analytics & Validation**
    *   Implement a comprehensive framework for Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA).
    *   Explore replacing a core statistical process with a Machine Learning model (e.g., GBM for progression), including Explainable AI (XAI) analysis.
    *   Validate model outputs against external benchmarks (e.g., PBS data, clinical trial results).

## Phase 3: User Experience & Dissemination

**Objective:** Make the model's power accessible to different audiences and translate its findings into actionable insights.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 3.1: Scenario & Results Management**
    *   Develop a simple Shiny application to act as a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up simulation scenarios and exploring high-level results.
    *   Create a suite of standardized reporting functions to generate tables, figures, and reports in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word).

*   **Pillar 3.2: Stakeholder-Specific Outputs**
    *   Develop an "Executive Dashboard" output summarizing key findings for policymakers.
    *   Create template outputs that align with the requirements of HTA bodies (PBAC, MSAC).
    *   Produce plain-language summaries and fact sheets for consumers and advocacy groups.

*   **Pillar 3.3: Documentation & Publication**
    *   Develop comprehensive technical documentation for the model.
    *   Create tutorials and vignettes on how to use the R package and run simulations.
    *   Prepare and submit multiple manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication, detailing the model's methodology and key policy findings.
