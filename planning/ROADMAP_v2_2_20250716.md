# AUS-OA Model v2 Development Roadmap

**File Version:** 2
**Date:** 2025-07-16

## Preamble

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for Version 2 of the AUS-OA microsimulation model. It is the synthesis of extensive consultation with a wide range of clinical, health economic, policy, consumer, and technical stakeholders. **This version incorporates feedback from the first round of stakeholder review of the V2 plan.** The goal of V2 is to transform the model from a research tool into a robust, transparent, and policy-relevant platform for decision-making in osteoarthritis.

## Phase 1: Architectural Relaunch & Core Clinical Engine

**Objective:** Re-engineer the model's architecture to be modular and scalable, while building a new core clinical engine driven by patient-reported outcomes and a flexible intervention framework.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 1.1: Software Engineering Best Practices**
    *   Refactor the entire project into a formal R package structure.
    *   Implement `renv` for rigorous dependency management.
    *   Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing.
    *   Containerize the model environment using Docker for full reproducibility.
    *   Adopt agile project management using a GitHub Projects board.

*   **Pillar 1.2: Decoupled & Enhanced Configuration**
    *   Externalize all model parameters (coefficients, costs, probabilities) into human-readable YAML configuration files.
    *   Develop a flexible "policy lever" system in the configuration to easily model new interventions, **including pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological programs, and medical device/technology choices.**

*   **Pillar 1.3: Performance Optimization**
    *   Profile the existing code to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Refactor core data manipulation logic to use the high-performance `data.table` package.
    *   Transition all data I/O from CSV/Excel to the efficient Parquet format using the `arrow` package.

*   **Pillar 1.4: Core Modules & Clinical Logic**
    *   **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) Integration:** Integrate PROs (e.g., pain, function scores) as a core component of the patient state and a primary driver of model progression and treatment decisions.
    *   **Flexible Intervention Module:** Develop a new module (replacing the old pharmacy module) capable of handling a wide range of interventions defined in the configuration, including drugs, physiotherapy, weight loss programs, and home modifications.
    *   **Enhanced Surgical Module:** Enhance the surgery module to differentiate revision reasons and incorporate long-term implant survivorship data.
    *   **Granular Costing Module:** Develop a formal, auditable costing module that maps events to specific **MBS and PBS item numbers**, calculates patient out-of-pocket costs, and includes methodologies for productivity and informal care costs. **Discounting will be an explicit feature.**

## Phase 2: Expanding the Scope of Analysis

**Objective:** Build upon the new architecture to incorporate more complex system interactions and answer deeper policy questions.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 2.1: Deepening Clinical & System Realism**
    *   Model key surgical complications (e.g., PJI, DVT).
    *   Incorporate the impact of key comorbidities on OA progression.
    *   **Health System Capacity Module:** Add the ability to model system capacity constraints and waiting list dynamics.
    *   Differentiate between **public and private** care pathways and their associated costs and outcomes.

*   **Pillar 2.2: Broadening the Economic & Social Perspective**
    *   Integrate the impact on carers (informal care costs, quality of life).
    *   Model the link to the residential aged care system.
    *   Analyze equity and access, using new geographic (remoteness) and socioeconomic variables in the synthetic population.

*   **Pillar 2.3: Advanced Analytics & Validation**
    *   Implement a comprehensive framework for Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA), **with standard outputs like Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves (CEACs).**
    *   Explore replacing a core statistical process with a Machine Learning model (e.g., GBM for progression), including Explainable AI (XAI) analysis.
    *   **Performance Review & `Rcpp`:** Profile the new V2 engine and implement `Rcpp` for the top 1-2 bottlenecks if required.

## Phase 3: User Experience & Dissemination

**Objective:** Make the model's power accessible to different audiences and translate its findings into actionable insights.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 3.1: Scenario & Results Management**
    *   Develop a simple Shiny application to act as a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up simulation scenarios and exploring high-level results.
    *   Create a suite of standardized reporting functions to generate tables, figures, and reports.
    *   **Develop a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for evaluating a new intervention.**

*   **Pillar 3.2: Stakeholder-Specific Outputs**
    *   Develop an "Executive Dashboard" output summarizing key findings for policymakers.
    *   Create an R Markdown template for HTA-compliant reports (for both PBAC and MSAC).
    *   Produce plain-language summaries and fact sheets for consumers and advocacy groups.
    *   **Develop analysis to support a "National OA Strategy" policy case.**

*   **Pillar 3.3: Documentation & Publication**
    *   Develop comprehensive technical documentation for the model and its API.
    *   Create tutorials and vignettes on how to use the R package and run simulations.
    *   Prepare and submit multiple manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication.
