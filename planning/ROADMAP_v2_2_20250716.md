# AUS-OA Model v2.0-beta Release Roadmap

**File Version:** 2
**Date:** 2025-07-16
**Status:** Completed as of 2025-07-31 (v2.0-beta)

## Preamble

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for Version 2 of the AUS-OA microsimulation model. It is the synthesis of extensive consultation with a wide range of clinical, health economic, policy, consumer, and technical stakeholders. **This version incorporates feedback from the first round of stakeholder review of the V2 plan.** The goal of V2 is to transform the model from a research tool into a robust, transparent, and policy-relevant platform for decision-making in osteoarthritis.

## Phase 1: Architectural Relaunch & Core Clinical Engine

**Objective:** Re-engineer the model's architecture to be modular and scalable, while building a new core clinical engine driven by patient-reported outcomes and a flexible intervention framework.

**Key Pillars:**

*   **Pillar 1.1: Software Engineering Best Practices**
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Refactor the entire project into a formal R package structure.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Implement `renv` for rigorous dependency management.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Containerize the model environment using Docker for full reproducibility.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Adopt agile project management using a GitHub Projects board.

*   **Pillar 1.2: Decoupled & Enhanced Configuration**
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Externalize all model parameters (coefficients, costs, probabilities) into human-readable YAML configuration files.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Develop a flexible "policy lever" system in the configuration to easily model new interventions, **including pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological programs, and medical device/technology choices.**

*   **Pillar 1.3: Performance Optimization**
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Profile the existing code to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** Refactor core data manipulation logic to use the high-performance `data.table` package.
    *   **[FUTURE (v3)]** Transition all data I/O from CSV/Excel to the efficient Parquet format using the `arrow` package.

*   **Pillar 1.4: Core Modules & Clinical Logic**
    *   **[IN PROGRESS]** **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) Integration:** Integrate PROs (e.g., pain, function scores) as a core component of the patient state and a primary driver of model progression and treatment decisions.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** **Flexible Intervention Module:** Develop a new module (replacing the old pharmacy module) capable of handling a wide range of interventions defined in the configuration, including drugs, physiotherapy, weight loss programs, and home modifications.
    *   **[COMPLETED]** **Enhanced Surgical Module:** Enhance the surgery module to differentiate revision reasons and incorporate long-term implant survivorship data.
    *   **[IN PROGRESS]** **Granular Costing Module:** Develop a formal, auditable costing module that maps events to specific **MBS and PBS item numbers**, calculates patient out-of-pocket costs, and includes methodologies for productivity and informal care costs. **Discounting will be an explicit feature.**

### Concluding Note for v2.0-beta

This document now reflects the completed work for the `v2.0-beta` release. All future work, including the finalization of "in progress" items and the original Phase 2 and 3 pillars, has been moved to `planning/ROADMAP_v3.md`.
