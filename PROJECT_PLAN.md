# Project Plan: Post-Development Phase

This document outlines the next steps for the AUS-OA model, focusing on execution, validation, and dissemination now that the core development, as defined by the original roadmap, is complete.

## Phase 1: Model Execution and Verification

**Objective:** Confirm that the model runs end-to-end and produces the expected outputs, including all tables and figures for analysis.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Execute the Master Script:**
    *   Run the main simulation script (`scripts/00_AUS_OA_Master.R`) to generate the full set of results.
    *   This will populate the `output/raw_output` and `output/model_stats` directories.
2.  **Generate Final Results:**
    *   Run the results script (`scripts/05_AUS_OA_Results.Rmd`) to produce all final tables, figures, and reports from the model outputs.
    *   Verify that all outputs are generated correctly in the `output/supplementary_materials` directory.
3.  **Create an End-to-End Test:**
    *   Adapt the master script into a formal, non-interactive end-to-end test. This test should run a small, deterministic simulation and check that the key outputs match a pre-defined, expected result. This will provide a baseline for future changes.

## Phase 2: Documentation and Usability

**Objective:** Improve the project's documentation to make it accessible and easy to use for researchers and other stakeholders.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Create a User Vignette:**
    *   Adapt the `scripts/05_AUS_OA_Results.Rmd` file into a formal R vignette that provides a narrative walkthrough of a typical analysis.
2.  **Build a `pkgdown` Website:**
    *   Use the `pkgdown` library to generate a full documentation website for the package, including function references and the vignette.
3.  **Enhance the README:**
    *   Add CI status badges, a code coverage badge, and a "quick-start" example to the `Readme.md` file.
4.  **Add Contribution Guidelines:**
    *   Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to explain how others can contribute to the project.

## Phase 3: Code Quality and Maintenance

**Objective:** Implement best practices for code quality to ensure the long-term maintainability of the project.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Implement Configuration Validation:**
    *   Add robust validation checks to the `R/config_loader.R` script to ensure all configuration files are correctly structured.
2.  **Enforce a Consistent Style:**
    *   Use the `styler` package to automatically format all R code in the repository.

## Phase 4: Scientific Validation and Dissemination

**Objective:** Finalize the scientific outputs of the project.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Expand Model Validation:**
    *   Run the `scripts/04_AUS_OA_Validate_model.Rmd` script and analyze the results to formally document the model's validity.
2.  **Finalize Manuscript:**
    *   Update the manuscript in the `manuscripts/` directory with the final, validated results.
