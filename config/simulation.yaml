# Simulation Setup Parameters

# --- General Settings ---
simulation:
  start_year: 2013
  length_years: 20
  set_seed: true

# --- Execution Modes ---
run_modes:
  # Run with probabilistic sampling for coefficients?
  probabilistic: false
  # Use calibration modifiers? (Overrides probabilistic)
  calibration_mode: false
  # Use parallel processing?
  parallelize: true
  # Number of cores to use if parallelize is true
  cores: 4

# --- Population Settings ---
population:
  # Scale factor for the base population
  scale: 0.1
  # Adjuster for the base population
  adjuster: 1.0
  # Input data file for generating a new base population
  base_population_file: "mysim_public.csv"
  # Pre-generated synthetic population to use if not generating a new one
  synthetic_population_file: "am_2013.parquet"

# --- File Paths (relative to project root) ---
# Note: In the new architecture, most of these will be handled automatically.
# This section is for reference and for parameters that might still be needed.
paths:
  input_directory: "input"
  output_directory: "output"
