\usage{
TKA_update_fcn(
  am_curr,
  am_new,
  pin,
  TKA_time_trend,
  OA_cust,
  cycle.coefficents
)
}
\arguments{
\item{am_curr}{A data.frame representing the attribute matrix for the current
cycle.}

\item{am_new}{A data.frame representing the attribute matrix for the next
cycle, which will be updated by this function.}

\item{pin}{A data.frame of parameter inputs (not currently used in this
version of the function, but may be kept for API consistency).}

\item{TKA_time_trend}{A data.frame containing the secular trend scaling
factors for TKA risk by year, sex, and age group.}

\item{OA_cust}{A data.frame with customisation factors for OA coefficients,
which are unusually applied to TKA coefficients here. This is flagged for
review in the code.}

\item{cycle.coefficents}{A list or data.frame of model coefficients for the
TKA initiation equation.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
\item{am_curr}{The \code{am_curr} data.frame with intermediate calculations.}
\item{am_new}{The \code{am_new} data.frame with updated TKA status (\code{tka}, \code{tka1},
\code{tka2}, \code{agetka1}, \code{agetka2}).}
\item{summ_tka_risk}{A placeholder value (currently \code{1}).}
}
\description{
This function models the probability of an individual undergoing a primary or
secondary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) in a given cycle. It calculates an
initial risk based on individual characteristics and then adjusts this risk
based on secular trends for different age and sex groups.
