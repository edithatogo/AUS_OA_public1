\title{Update BMI for one cycle}
\usage{
BMI_mod_fcn(am_curr, cycle.coefficents, BMI_cust)
}
\arguments{
\item{am_curr}{A data.frame or data.table representing the attribute matrix
of the population for the current cycle. It must contain columns for 'bmi',
'sex', 'age', and 'year12'.}

\item{cycle.coefficents}{A list or data.frame containing the regression
coefficients for the BMI progression model.}

\item{BMI_cust}{A data.frame containing calibration factors to be applied
to the BMI change.}
}
\value{
The updated attribute matrix (am_curr) with a new 'd_bmi' column
representing the change in BMI for the cycle.
}
\description{
This function updates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each individual in the
attribute matrix for a single simulation cycle. The update rules are based on
regression coefficients that differ by sex, age, and socioeconomic status.
}
\examples{
# This is a simplified example and will not run without the full model setup.
# am_sample <- data.frame(
#   bmi = 25,
#   sex = "[1] Male",
#   age = 45,
#   year12 = 1,
#   d_bmi = 0
# )
# coeffs <- list(c1_cons = 0.1, c1_year12 = -0.05, c1_age = 0.01, c1_bmi = 0.02)
# bmi_calib <- data.frame(covariate_set = "c1", proportion_reduction = 1.0)
# updated_am <- BMI_mod_fcn(am_sample, coeffs, bmi_calib)
