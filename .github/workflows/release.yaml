# Workflow for creating a GitHub release.
#
# This workflow is based on the 'release' workflow from r-lib/actions.
#
# For more information, see: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/
#
# This workflow will:
#
# 1. Create a GitHub release when a new tag is pushed.
# 2. Build the package and upload it as a release asset.
